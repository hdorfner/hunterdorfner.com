# hunterdorfner.com

A simple, single-page personal website for Hunter Dorfner. The site highlights an introduction, experience, education, and key contact links in a clean layout.

## Getting started

Open `index.html` in your browser to preview the site locally. Customize the content in each section or adjust the visual styling by editing `styles.css`.

When you need to mirror the Cloudflare Pages build locally, run:

```bash
npm run build
```

The script copies the static assets into a `dist/` folder and decodes the Base64 social preview image so the published site serves `social-preview.png`, matching the structure Pages expects during deployment.

### Metadata

The `<head>` includes SEO and social sharing metadata. Update the description, canonical URL, and social tags to reflect any changes to your branding or hosting domain.

For richer link previews, update [`social-preview.base64`](social-preview.base64) with a Base64-encoded 1200×630 PNG. Run `npm run build` (or `npm run generate-preview`) to regenerate the binary file in `dist/` so the published site serves the updated preview image.

The site also includes a vector favicon at [`favicon.svg`](favicon.svg). Replace it with your own artwork (keeping the same filename) and run `npm run build` to ensure the icon is copied into `dist/` for Safari tabs, bookmarks, and pinned tabs.

## Deploying with Cloudflare Pages

1. Sign in to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/) and choose **Workers & Pages → Create application → Pages**.
2. Select **Connect to Git**, authorize Cloudflare to access your GitHub account if prompted, and pick the `hunterdorfner.com` repository.
3. Configure the deployment settings:
   * **Production branch**: `main` (or your preferred live branch).
   * **Root directory**: leave this field blank so Pages builds from the repository root.
   * **Build command**: `npm run build`.
   * **Build output directory**: `dist` (the folder generated by the build script).

   If the setup wizard does not expose the build command/output fields, finish creating the
   project with the defaults. The repository includes [`.cloudflare/pages.yml`](.cloudflare/pages.yml),
   so Cloudflare will automatically read `npm run build` and `dist` from that file on the next
   deployment.

   If the dashboard forces a **Deploy command**, keep the existing value (for example,
   `npx wrangler deploy`). The repository now ships with a [`wrangler.jsonc`](wrangler.jsonc)
   configuration that points Wrangler to the static assets in `dist`, so the command succeeds
   even when the field cannot be cleared.
4. Click **Save and Deploy**. Cloudflare Pages will clone the repository, run the lightweight build step, and publish the site at a `*.pages.dev` preview URL.
5. Under your new Pages project, open **Settings → Custom domains** to add `hunterdorfner.com` (or another domain you control). Follow the prompts to activate the domain; Cloudflare will generate the required DNS records automatically if the domain is already managed in your Cloudflare account.
6. After DNS propagates, the custom domain will serve the latest build from the repository. Future pushes to the production branch trigger automatic redeploys.

### Troubleshooting Cloudflare Pages build errors

If a deployment fails with a log similar to:

```
Executing user deploy command: npx wrangler deploy
✘ [ERROR] Missing entry-point to Worker script or to assets directory
```

Cloudflare is trying to run the Wrangler CLI instead of publishing your static files. Configure the Pages project to use the lightweight build step instead:

1. In the Cloudflare dashboard, open your Pages project and go to **Settings → Build & deploy → Build configuration**.
2. Set **Build command** to `npm run build` and **Build output directory** to `dist`.
3. Save the configuration, then trigger a new deployment from the **Deployments** tab or by pushing a commit. The next build should finish successfully because Pages will copy the static files into `dist/` and publish that folder.

If you see `Failed: root directory not found` immediately after cloning the repository, Cloudflare Pages cannot find the folder you specified under **Root directory**. Edit the project’s build settings, clear that field (or point it to the actual subfolder you want), save, and redeploy.

If the dashboard still hides the build output directory field, confirm the project has permission to
read repo-stored configuration by opening **Settings → Build & deploy → Build configuration** and
enabling **Use configuration file**. The `.cloudflare/pages.yml` checked into the repository
contains the correct `build_output_directory: dist` value, so future deploys will succeed without
manual inputs.

## Resolving merge conflicts on GitHub

If GitHub reports merge conflicts when you open a pull request:

1. Fetch the latest changes from the default branch locally.
   ```bash
   git fetch origin
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   git checkout work
   git merge origin/main
   ```
2. Git will pause at each conflicting file. Open those files, look for the conflict markers (`<<<<<<<`, `=======`, `>>>>>>>`), and decide which changes to keep.
3. Remove the markers and adjust the surrounding content so the file reads correctly, then save the file.
4. Stage the resolved files and complete the merge.
   ```bash
   git add <resolved-files>
   git commit
   ```
5. Push the updated branch and reload the pull request. GitHub should now show “This branch has no conflicts”.

If you prefer rebasing instead of merging, run `git rebase origin/main` on your feature branch and resolve conflicts as they appear before pushing with `git push --force-with-lease`.
